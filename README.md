# Fake-News-Detector

This is a fake news detector, using multiple Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, KNNeighbors, and Random Forest). 

I am using data from news_articles.csv.

As of 5/4/2022 the accuracy is ~82.63% after using GridSearchCV on Logistic Regression.

There will be more improvements to come such as creating visuals (wordmaps, heatmaps, confusion matrix, etc.).

Later on I will be using Transformers to see if there are improvements in accuracy.
