This is a fake news detector, using multiple Machine Learning models (Logistic Regression, KNNeighbors, and Random Forest).

I am using data from news_articles.csv.

As of 7/26/2022 the accuracy is ~74% after using GridSearchCV on Logistic Regression.

There will be more improvements to come such as creating visuals (word clouds, heatmaps, confusion matrix, etc.).

Later on I will be using Passive Aggressive Classifier and Transformers to see if there are improvements in accuracy.
